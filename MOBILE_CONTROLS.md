# Mobile Controls Guide

## Gyroscope Steering (Tilt Controls)

The game now supports **device orientation/gyroscope** controls for mobile devices!

### How It Works:

1. **On iOS 13+**: 
   - Tap the screen once to trigger permission request
   - Allow motion & orientation access when prompted
   - Tilt your device left/right to steer

2. **On Android**:
   - Gyroscope activates automatically
   - Tilt your device left/right to steer

### Calibration:
- The gyroscope **auto-calibrates** on first tilt
- Hold your device in a comfortable position when you start
- Tilt **30 degrees** left or right for full steering lock

### Touch Controls:
- **Horizontal swipe**: Steer left/right (works alongside gyro)
- **Vertical swipe**: 
  - Swipe **up** = Throttle/accelerate
  - Swipe **down** = Brake/reverse

### Testing Gyroscope:
1. Open the game on your mobile device
2. Tap "Start Race"
3. Tap the screen to enable gyroscope (iOS only)
4. Tilt your device left/right - the car should steer
5. Swipe up to accelerate

### Troubleshooting:
- **No steering**: Make sure you've granted motion permissions
- **Inverted controls**: Try recalibrating by refreshing the page
- **Too sensitive**: The sensitivity is set to 30° for full lock - this is optimal for most devices
